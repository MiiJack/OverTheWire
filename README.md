# OverTheWire - Bandit
This repo contains a level-by-level guide for OverTheWire's Bandit wargame, designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to fundamental Linux commands.

Access the instructions for each level at https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/

In order to begin the game, you are to connect through ssh and provide the password to the prompt
```sh
ssh bandit*@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
``*`` : the number of the level you're progressing into

Please note that elements like passwords and RSA keys may change at OverTheWire's discretion. But the overall methodology will remain the same.
